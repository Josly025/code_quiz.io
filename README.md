# Using Vanilla JavaScript to make a countdown timer and button regulated quiz

---

# Boostrap Portfolio

### Description

- Goal: This project was based on generating a timed
  quiz that counted down after the quiz started. As the questioned were
  answered incorrectly, 20 seconds should be deducted from the score.
  Additionally, the score (countdown time remained) was to be stored
  via a link to highscores in the upper left pane of the document.

### Installation Instruction

N/A

### Usage Instructions

- Use the start button to begin the countdown clock
- Answer all five questions to the best of your ability
- finish and insert your initals and score into the prompt

### Credits/Thanks

- My tutor: I had a lot of work on how to make an object of my
  questions that was easily indexed through my loops.

- W3schools & CodeAcademy: Several JavaScript definitions

### License Information

N/A

### Future Goals

- Overall, I would like to become a lot more comfortable using JavaScript.
  I feel like I am not fully comfortable applying loops and functions to major
  concepts such as hiding and showing questions. I would like to become faster
  at writing code because I spend a lot of time debugging and recreating code based on
  errors.
